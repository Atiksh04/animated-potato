 # Frontend Assignment 🚀

 Welcome to our frontend assignment! In this project, you will be building a React mention component. 🛠️

 The component should match the given style, but feel free to add your own flair! 🎨

 Most importantly, make sure your component is testable and extendable. We love clean, modular code! 🧹

 Happy coding! 💻


 Bonus Points 🌟

 - If you can add configurable animations to the component, that's fantastic! 🎭
 - Setting up a CI/CD pipeline that runs your test cases and checks for linting errors would be super impressive! 🚀

 Remember, we value creativity and initiative. Show us what you've got! 💪

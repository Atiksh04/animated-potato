 # Frontend Assignment üöÄ

 Welcome to our frontend assignment! In this project, you will be building a React mention component. üõ†Ô∏è


 You have been provided with the following [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/EEmRktq44VPR3u8Lx7otOJ/Frontend-Assignment---Dropdown?type=design&t=YyUdu9qHBb3sS66T-6) for a mention component by your company‚Äôs design team and you have been tasked to implement it as much as possible in 2 hours. All the best!

 
 Instructions:

 - Use any FE framework of your choice.
 - You can use Javascript, Typescript or anything else that runs on a browser.
 - Mention has two components
    - Input element
    - Select box for searching names
 - User can type any text in input element but when user writes `@` then a select box should appear from where user can select a name and it should be displayed in input element for example ` Hi @Luke Skywalker may the force be with you.`.

 
 What we look for:

 - Thinking: Are you able to think through any edge cases?
 - Look & feel: Does the app work well across modern browsers?
 - JS/TS: How is the data flow & state modeled?
 - JS/TS: How well is it structured?
 - Tests: How well is the code tested through unit/integration tests?
 - Documentation: How anyone new can run this app locally and contribute to it?
 - Code organisation: How organised components are and how components are implemented?

What we don‚Äôt look for:

 - Custom select box: You need not implement a custom select box. You‚Äôre welcome to use the native select box or an existing library if you desire.
 -  Styles



 Most importantly, make sure your component is testable and extendable. We love clean, modular code! üßπ


 From where you can get data for options while triggering mention actions
 - Use data present in data.json as raw data for mention component.
 
 Remember, we value creativity and initiative. Show us what you've got! üí™

 Happy coding! üíª
